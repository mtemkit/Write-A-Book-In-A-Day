# Write-A-Book-In-A-Day

### Purpose:

The aim of this code is to allow me to write a full novel (of any chapter length) with a few minutes of effort.

### Languages used: 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (w/ Node.JS) 

### APIs used:

OpenAI

### How does it work?

All I need to do is provide inputs for the following traits of a novel below, and the code should output a complete book using OpenAI:

(1) main character name\
(2) main character personality\
(3) main character purpose\
(4) novel starting scenario\
(5) novel setting\
(6) novel plot\
(7) novel lesson\
(8) novel ending\
(9) novel extra information

### How long does it take the program complete the book?

After entering inputs, it usually takes the program around 1-3 minutes per 10 chapters outputted. This means that it could take up to a day to complete a novel with thousands of chapters.
